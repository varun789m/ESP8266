If you don’t see the last line but just more and more dots ........., 
then likely name or password to the Wi-Fi network is entered incorrectly in the sketch.

Note: if connection is established, and then lost for some reason, ESP will automatically

Wi-Fi library, without any user intervention.

That’s all you need to connect ESP8266 to Wi-Fi. In the following chapters we will explain what cool things 
can be done by the ESP once it’s connected.
